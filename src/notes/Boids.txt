                        Boids
        simulation models flocking behavior
-----------------------------------------------------

-- Coherence
-   Each boid flies towards the other boids.
-   But don't immediately fly directly at each other
-   They gradually steer towards each other,
    at the rate that you can adjust with the "coherence slider" 

-- Separation
-   Each boid tries to avoid running into the other boids.
-   If it gets too close to another boid it will steer away
-   You can control how quickly it steer with the "separation slider.

-- Alignment
-   Each boid tries to match the vector (speed and direction)
    of the other boids around it.
-   You can control how quickly they try to match vectors using the "coherence slider"
